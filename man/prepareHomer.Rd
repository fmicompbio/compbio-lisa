\title{Prepare input files for HOMER motif enrichment analysis.}
\usage{
prepareHomer(
  gr,
  b,
  genomedir,
  outdir,
  motifFile,
  homerfile = findHomer(),
  regionsize = "given",
  Ncpu = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{A \code{GRanges} object (or an object that can be coerced to one)
with the genomic regions to analyze.}

\item{b}{A vector of the same length as \code{gr} that groups its elements
into bins (typically a factor).}

\item{genomedir}{Directory containing sequence files in Fasta format (one per chromosome).}

\item{outdir}{A path specifying the folder into which the output files (two
files per unique value of \code{b}) will be written.}

\item{motifFile}{A file with HOMER formatted PWMs to be used in the enrichment analysis.}

\item{homerfile}{Path and file name of the \code{findMotifsGenome.pl} HOMER script.}

\item{regionsize}{The peak size to use in HOMER (\code{"given"} keeps the coordinate
region, an integer value will keep only that many bases in the region center).}

\item{Ncpu}{Number of parallel threads that HOMER can use.}
}
\value{
The path and name of the script file to run the HOMER motif enrichment
    analysis.
}
\description{
For each bin, write genomic coordinates for foreground and
    background regions into files for HOMER motif enrichment analysis.
}
\details{
For each bin (unique value of \code{b}) this functions creates two files
    in \code{outdir} (\code{outdir/bin_N_foreground.tab} and \code{outdir/bin_N_background.tab},
    where \code{N} is the number of the bin and foreground/background correspond to
    the ranges that are/are not within the current bin). The files are in the
    HOMER peak file format (see http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/ngs/peakMotifs.html for details).

    In addition, a shell script file is created containing the shell commands
    to run the HOMER motif enrichment analysis.
