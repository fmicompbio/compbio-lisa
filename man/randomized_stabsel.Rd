\title{Randomized Lasso Stability Selection}
\usage{
randomized_stabsel(x = x, y = y, weakness = 0.8, cutoff = 0.8, PFER = 2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the predictor matrix.}

\item{y}{the response vector.}

\item{weakness}{parameter that can take a value between 0 and 1. It affects how strict the method will be in
selecting predictors. It is set to 0.8 by default. The closer it goes to 0 the more stringent the selection. A
weakness value of 1 is identical to performing lasso stability selection (not the randomized version).}

\item{cutoff}{value between 0 and 1 which is the cutoff for the selection probability. Any variable
with a selection probability that is higher than the set cutoff will be selected. It is set to 0.8 by default.}

\item{PFER}{the absolute number of false positives that we allow for in the final list of
selected variables. For details see Meinshausen and Bühlmann (2010).}

\item{...}{additional parameters for \code{glmnet}.}
}
\value{
a \code{stabsel} object. It contains the following:
\itemize{
 \item phat - a matrix containing selection probabilities, where columns are regularization steps and rows
 are predictors.
 \item selected - a vector containing the selected predictors.
 \item max - maximum of selection probabilities.
 \item cutoff - the selection probability cutoff.
 \item q - average number of selected variables used.
 \item PFER - the realized upper bound for the per-family error rate (number of falsely selected predictors among the group of selected predictors).
 \item specifiedPFER - the set upper bound for the per-family error rate (number of falsely selected predictors among the group of selected predictors).
 \item p - the total number of predictors.
 \item B - the number of subsamples.
 \item sampling.type - sampling type used for stability selection.
 \item assumption - assumptions made on the selection probabilities.
 \item call - the call.

\description{
This function runs randomized lasso stability selection as presented by Meinshausen
and Bühlmann (2010) and with the improved error bounds introduced by Shah and Samworth (2013). The function
uses the \code{stabsel} function from the \code{stabs} package, but implements the randomized lasso version.
}
\details{
Randomized lasso stability selection runs randomized lasso several times on subsamples of
the response variable and predictor matrix (stability selection). N/2 elements from the response variable are
randomly chosen, where N is the length of the vector. Their corresponsing section of the predictor matrix is
also chosen, and the \code{glmnet.randomized_lasso} function is applied. This is done multiple times, and
results in selection probabilities for each predictor. The probability of a specific predictor is the number of
times it was selected divided by the total number of subsamples that were done (total number of times the
regression was performed).

We make use of the \code{stabs} package that implements lasso stability selection, and adapt it to run the
randomized lasso stability selection. The output is an object of type \code{stabsel}.
