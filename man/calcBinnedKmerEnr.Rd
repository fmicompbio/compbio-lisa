\arguments{
\item{seqs}{\code{\link[Biostrings]{DNAStringSet}} object with sequences to test}

\item{bins}{factor of the same length and order as \code{seqs}, indicating
the bin for each sequence. Typically the return value of
\code{\link[monaLisa]{bin}}. For \code{background = "genome"} or
\code{background = "model"}, \code{bins} can be omitted.}

\item{kmerLen}{A \code{numeric} scalar giving the k-mer length.}

\item{background}{A \code{character} scalar specifying the background sequences
to use. One of \code{"otherBins"} (default), \code{"allBins"}, \code{"zeroBin"},
\code{"genome"} or \code{"model"} (see "Details").}

\item{MMorder}{A \code{numeric} scalar giving the order of the Markov model
used to calculate the expected frequencies for \code{background = "model"}.}

\item{test}{A \code{character} scalar specifying the type of enrichment test
to perform. One of \code{"fisher"} (default) or \code{"binomial"}. The
enrichment test is one-sided (enriched in foreground).}

\item{includeRevComp}{A \code{logical} scalar. If \code{TRUE} (default),
count k-mer occurrences in both \code{seqs} and their reverse-complement,
by concatenating \code{seqs} and their reverse-complemented versions
before the counting. This is useful if motifs can be expected to occur
on any strand (e.g. DNA sequences of ChIP-seq peaks). If motifs are only
expected on the forward strand (e.g. RNA sequences of CLIP-seq peaks),
\code{includeRevComp = FALSE} should be used. Note that \code{bins}
will be recycled for the reverse complemented sequences, which means that
each reverse-complemented sequence will be assigned to the same bib as the
corresponding forward sequence.}

\item{maxFracN}{A numeric scalar with the maximal fraction of N bases allowed
in a sequence (defaults to 0.7). Sequences with higher fractions are
excluded from the analysis.}

\item{maxKmerSize}{the maximum k-mer size to consider, when adjusting
background sequence weights for k-mer composition compared to the
foreground sequences. The default value (3) will correct for mono-, di-
and tri-mer composition.}

\item{GCbreaks}{The breaks between GC bins. The default value is based on
the hard-coded bins used in Homer.}

\item{pseudocount.kmers}{A \code{numeric} scalar - will be added to the
observed and expected counts for each k-mer to avoid zero values.}

\item{pseudocount.log2enr}{A numerical scalar with the pseudocount to add to
foreground and background counts when calculating log2 motif enrichments}

\item{pseudofreq.pearsonResid}{A numerical scalar with the pseudo-frequency
to add to background frequencies when calculating Pearson residuals.
The value needs to be in [0,1] and corresponds to the minimal expected
fraction of background sequences that contain at least one motif hit.}

\item{p.adjust.method}{A character scalar selecting the p value adjustment
method (used in \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}}).}

\item{genome}{A \code{BSgenome} or \code{DNAStringSet} object with the
genome sequence. Only used for \code{background = "genome"} for extracting
background sequences.}

\item{genome.regions}{An optional \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} object
defining the intervals in \code{genome} from which background sequences are
sampled for \code{background = "genome"}. If \code{NULL}, background
sequences are sampled randomly from \code{genome}.}

\item{genome.oversample}{A \code{numeric} scalar of at least 1.0 defining how
many background sequences will be sampled per foreground sequence for
\code{background = "genome"}. Larger values will take longer but improve
the sequence composition similarity between foreground and background
(see \code{"Details"}).}

\item{genome.seed}{An \code{integer} scalar used to seed the random number
generator before sampling regions.}

\item{BPPARAM}{An optional \code{\link[BiocParallel]{BiocParallelParam}}
instance determining the parallel back-end to be used during evaluation.}

\item{verbose}{A \code{logical} scalar. If \code{TRUE}, report on progress.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment}} object
  with motifs in rows and bins in columns, containing six assays: \itemize{
  \item{negLog10P}{: -log10 P values}
  \item{negLog10Padj}{: -log10 adjusted P values}
  \item{pearsonResid}{: k-mer enrichments as Pearson residuals}
  \item{log2enr}{: k-mer enrichments as log2 ratios}
  \item{sumForegroundWgtWithHits}{: Sum of foreground sequence weights
    in a bin that have k-mer occurrences}
  \item{sumBackgroundWgtWithHits}{: Sum of background sequence weights
    in a bin that have k-mer occurrences}
}
}
\description{
Given a set of sequences and corresponding bins, identify
  enriched k-mers (n-grams) in each bin. The sequences can be given either
  directly or as genomic coordinates.
}
\details{
This function implements a binned k-mer enrichment analysis. In each
  enrichment analysis, the sequences in a specific bin are used as foreground
  sequences to test for k-mer enrichments comparing to background sequences
  (defined by \code{background}, see below), similarly as in done for motifs
  in \code{\link{calcBinnedMotifEnrR}}. Sequences are weighted to correct for
  GC and shorter k-mer composition differences between fore- and background
  sets.
  
  The background sequences are defined according to the value of the
  \code{background} argument:
  \itemize{
    \item{otherBins}{: sequences from all other bins (excluding the current bin)}
    \item{allBins}{: sequences from all bins (including the current bin)}
    \item{zeroBin}{: sequences from the "zero bin", defined by the
      \code{maxAbsX} argument of \code{\link[monaLisa]{bin}}. If \code{bins}
      does not define a "zero bin", for example because it was created by
      \code{bin(..., maxAbsX = NULL)}, selecting this background definition
      will abort with an error.}
    \item{genome}{: sequences randomly sampled from the genome (or the
      intervals defined in \code{genome.regions} if given). For each
      foreground sequence, \code{genome.oversample} background sequences
      of the same size are sampled (on average). From these, one per
      foreground sequence is selected trying to match the G+C composition.
      In order to make the sampling deterministic, the random number
      generator is seeded using \code{genome.seed}.}
    \item{model}{: a Markov model of the order \code{MMorder} is estimated
      from the foreground sequences and used to estimate expected k-mer
      frequencies. K-mer enrichments are then calculated comparing observed
      to these expected frequencies.}
  }

  For each k-mer, the weights of sequences is multiplied with the number
  of k-mer occurrences in each sequence and summed, separately for foreground
  (\code{sumForegroundWgtWithHits}) and background
  (\code{sumBackgroundWgtWithHits}) sequences. The function works in ZOOPS
  (Zero-Or-One-Per-Sequence) mode, so at most one occurrence per
  sequence is counted, which helps reduce the impact of sequence repeats.
  The total foreground (\code{totalWgtForeground}) and background
  (\code{totalWgtBackground}) sum of sequence weights is also calculated. If
  a k-mer has zero \code{sumForegroundWgtWithHits} and
  \code{sumBackgroundWgtWithHits}, then any values (p-values and enrichment)
  that are calculated using these two numbers are set to NA.

  Two statistical tests for the calculation of enrichment log p-value are
  available: \code{test = "fisher"} (default) to perform Fisher's exact
  tests, or \code{test = "binomial"} to perform binomial tests, using:
  \itemize{
    \item{fisher}{: \code{fisher.test(x = tab, alternative =
      "greater")}, where \code{tab} is the contingency table with the summed
      weights of sequences in foreground or background sets (rows), and with
      or without a occurrences of a particular k-mer (columns).}
    \item{binomial}{: \code{pbinom(q = sumForegroundWgtWithHits - 1, size =
      totalWgtForeground, prob = sumBackgroundWgtWithHits / totalWgtBackground,
      lower.tail = FALSE, log.p = TRUE)}}
  }
