\usage{
getKmerFreq(
  seqs,
  kmerLen = 5,
  MMorder = 1,
  pseudoCount = 1,
  zoops = TRUE,
  strata = rep(1L, length(seqs))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seqs}{Set of sequences, either a \code{character} vector or a
\code{\link{DNAStringSet}}.}

\item{kmerLen}{A \code{numeric} scalar giving the k-mer length.}

\item{MMorder}{A \code{numeric} scalar giving the order of the Markov model
used to calculate the expected frequencies.}

\item{pseudoCount}{A \code{numeric} scalar - will be added to the observed
counts for each k-mer to avoid zero values.}

\item{zoops}{A \code{logical} scalar. If \code{TRUE} (the default), only one
or zero occurences of a k-mer are considered per sequence.}

\item{strata}{A \code{factor} or a \code{numeric} scalar defining the strata
of sequences. A separate Markov model and expected k-mer frequencies are
estimated for the set of sequences in each stratum (level in a \code{strata}
factor). If \code{strata} is a scalar value, it will be interpreted as the
number of strata to split the sequences into according to their CpG
observed-over-expected counts using \code{kmeans(CpGoe, centers = strata)}.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with observed and expected k-mer frequencies (\code{freq.obs}
  and \code{freq.exp}, respectively), and enrichment statistics for each k-mer.
}
\description{
Given a set of sequences, calculate observed and expected k-mer
  frequencies. Expected frequencies are based on a Markov model of order
  \code{MMorder}.
