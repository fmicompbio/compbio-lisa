\title{Randomized Lasso}
\usage{
glmnet.randomized_lasso(
  x,
  y,
  q,
  weakness = 1,
  type = c("conservative", "anticonservative"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the predictor matrix.}

\item{y}{the response vector.}

\item{q}{the average number of selected variables.}

\item{weakness}{parameter used randomized lasso (see details).}

\item{type}{parameter from \code{lars.lasso} function in \code{stabs}. It is a character vector specifying
how much the PFER should be controlled. If type is "conservative" then the number of selected variables per
subsample is <= q. If type is "anticonservative" then the number of selected variables per subsample is >= q.
By default the conservative type is chosen.}

\item{...}{additional parameters for \code{glmnet}.}
}
\value{
the regression output which consists of a list of length 2. The list contains the following:
\itemize{
 \item selected - a logical vector of length equal to the total number of predictors. The predictors that were chosen have a value of TRUE.
 \item path - a logical matrix containing the regularization steps as columns and the predictors as rows. An entry of TRUE indicates selection.
}
}
\description{
This function performs randomized lasso using the \code{glmnet} package. The
function present in the \code{stabs} package that runs the lasso version was adapted for
the randomized lasso here. Randmized lasso stability selection uses this function repeatedly
to select predictors.
}
\details{
This function is identical to \code{glmnet.lasso} from the \code{stabs} package. The only addition is the weakness parameter
which has been added when calling the \code{glmnet} function by setting penalty.factor = 1/runif(ncol(x), weakness, 1)
where ncol(x) is the number of predictors.
